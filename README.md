# Hellotext WordPress - WooCommerce Plugin

If you have a store using WooCommerce, you can easily connect it to Hellotext.

By connecting your WooCommerce store, you'll be able to start tracking all your customers' activity, automatically creating profiles with their data and updating them with the activities they perform.

The following activities are tracked automatically:

With this information, you'll be able to create segmented audiences and much more effective promotional campaigns.
